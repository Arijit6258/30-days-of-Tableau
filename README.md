# 30 Days of Tableau

### I will be uploading all my notes and the visualizations of these 30 days here.

I am starting with #30daysoftableau today.

Before starting anything, we need to be clear about why we are doing this? 
So, let me answer this first.

#### What is Tableau?
Tableau is a powerful and fastest-growing data visualization tool used in the Business Intelligence Industry. 

#### Why did I choose to learn Tableau?
It helps in simplifying raw data into a very easily understandable format. Data analysis is very fast with Tableau. It is easy to connect to different data sources. So you can add Excel spreadsheets and upgrade it with awesome visual dashboards. 

#### Who should use Tableau?
If your goal is to become a data professional, then you should definitely go for it. A data guy should know when to use the right tools, and the tools for a data professional are Python, Tableau, R, etc.

#### Tableau vs Python/R:
This is the wrong framing of the question. Itâ€™s like saying should I buy a bread knife or a steak knife. They both have their applications.

So, stop worrying about which one is better and start learning. At the end of the day, learning is always enriching and fun.

## I highly recommend every one who is following my notes to start from Day 1 of my notes. Don't skip in middle, else you will be confused (FOR BEGINNERS) !
